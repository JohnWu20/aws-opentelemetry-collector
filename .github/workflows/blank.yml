# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Integ-test

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master, workflow-1 ]
  
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master, workflow-1 ]


# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel

  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
